# Restuarant-recommendation-system


The main aim of this project is to make a restaurant recommendation system. We wish to address the confusion that arises when individuals come together to choose a restaurant of their choice which accommodates all of their tastes and preferences. Current applications in the market offer very generic advice or are motivated by advertising revenue which leads to more conflicts and broken relationships. This project aims to use the K-nearest neighbors algorithm as a means to recommend restaurants to users. In addition, to the KNN algorithm, we also intend to factor in a user’s initial preferences and their past history of restaurant choices (further details to be decided later).
